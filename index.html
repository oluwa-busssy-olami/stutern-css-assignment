                <i>WHAT COMES TO MIND WHEN I HEAR THE WORD TECHNOLOGY?</i>
            </h2>
            <p>
                <b>My love for technology hmm,
                   </b> I can't talk about my love for technology without saying how I got into tech </p>
            <p>Tbh, the very first time I heard about tech was in 2020 after successfully taking a class on text animation, my brother happened to be in the online class he was so impressed so he said why not go into technology at first I was confused Iâ€™d
                remember laughing out loud that the fact I'm able to do this doesn't mean I can this do but he is an achiever. He got me a system January 14th, 2021. I was excited that I now own a laptop (funny though) but then It was one of the things
                I've always as a teen. I needed to do something then I start with HTML but I didn't end so well the first year due to school exams but that isn't an excuse right but doing 3 semesters in a year was quite stressful and draining to me, and
                also my laptop screen broke due to my carelessness basically spent a year trying to focus on schol work.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to 2022, and my loving brother decided to get me a course on udemy I was glad that I would be able to perform well since I now have a tool, yes I did honestly, but that didn't last also (the whole excitement) but it was fun while
                it lasted I did quite well the first two months of the strike then my phone got spoilt then I was left with my laptop and no power supply for months at night when I'm to work I get stressed after cooking for 3hours I immediately pass out
                after eating and wake up some nights that wasn't fun honestly and don't ask what I do with my day.</p>
            <p>Technology has been my greatness blessing, i'd remember the very day I wrote "Hello World" on my code editor then it displayed in the web browser I talked about it for days also, it has shaped the way I think, the way communicate; one thing
                I've learnt is that communication opens doors and honestly, creating an user interface is so much fun, I know I'm not there but I'm trusting the process and Stutern thank you for this great opportunity. I sincerely appreciate, Temidayo
                as a member of my group but more like an accountability partner she's truly a leader her name is here because when I talk about my love for technology I think about how resilient she is and want everyone around her to be.</p>
            <p>I enjoy everything about technology honestly and I didn't realise it until September and during the last task.</p>

            <h2> <i>What I've learnt so far?</i></h2>
            <p>Learning <b>GIT</b> wasn't easy it took me to understand how to push code on Github without copying and pasting and I'm grateful to Temidayo who organished on online section last Sunday on how to push code on Github, I learnt how to structure
                a website with help of HTML. </p>
            <p>What is CSS? Cascading stylesheets, I've learnt css is a language that use to describe the visual representation of the document</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The selectors are the element your want to style h1, p, input are all selectors</li>
                <li>Be able to access information when you need it, not cramming allin your head</li>
                <li>We also have three different way to write code which are <b>INLINE</b>, the <b>INTERNAL</b>, styling and, the <b>EXTERNAL STYLESHEET</b> which is the best way to style a document using the <i><b>link.</b></i></li>
                <li>Specificity is how browser decides which rules to apply when multiple rules could apply to same element, a measure of how specific a given selector is the mor specific selector "wins".</li>
                <li>ID > CLASS > ELEMENT</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Padding,</b> is the space between the content box and the border of an element also, is commonly used when you're spacing thing out and you want to make something breathe a bit. Padding can be applied in the following way listed below</p>

            </ul>
